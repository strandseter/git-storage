A lightweight Node.js library that enables Git-based data storage by directly managing and committing data to Git repositories. It transforms Git remotes into simple, version-controlled databases, perfect for small websites and static projects.

## Features

- **Git as Database** - Transform any Git repository into a version-controlled database
- **Multiple Adapters** - Support for local GitHub repositories (bitbucket, gitlab, etc. coming soon)
- **TypeScript First** - Full TypeScript support with type-safe operations
- **CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, delete, count, and exists operations
- **Automatic Commits** - Changes are automatically committed and pushed to remote
- **JSON Storage** - Simple JSON-based data storage with ID-based records
