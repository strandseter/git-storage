# git-storage

This is a lightweight Node.js library that enables Git-based data storage by directly managing and committing data to Git repositories. It transforms Git remotes into simple, version-controlled databases, perfect for small websites and static projects.

## Features

- Simple API for storing and committing data
- Automatically commits changes to a Git repository
- Supports TypeScript and JavaScript

## TODO

- There are conflict issues when running tests. Find a more robust way to handle race conditions. Consider using different files for each test to avoid conflicts.
